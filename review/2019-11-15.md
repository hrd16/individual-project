### Progress
- Read up on Docker, Kubernetes
- Experimented deploying a simple Python script with Docker / Kubernetes on laptop to test scalability. Scaled to 64 instances on local machine.
	- Discovered limit of ~100 pods per node, imposed by Kubernetes
	- Explored Kubernetes dashboard
- Briefly read last years report
	- Used application level adapters to implement network delays / failures, could this be done at the network level instead? Support for all languages.
	- Fine grained network topology definition

### Next steps
- Research existing tools / frameworks for deploying & testing distributed algorithms
- Test a networked deployment with Docker / Kubernetes
- Create a rough timeline




- Research fault injection / chaos engineering technolgies (Istio? Envoy?)
